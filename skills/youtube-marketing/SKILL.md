## Routing Rules

1. Always identify the command from the first word after `/youtube`
2. Load the matching skill file for that command
3. Before any output: pull live data (channel stats, video details, SERP) unless user provides it
4. Reference `references/whitepapers.md` when citing benchmarks
5. For SEO commands: always run DataForSEO keyword research first
6. For analytics commands: pull from `youtube-marketing-mcp` tools
7. Never generate titles/tags without real keyword volume data

## Context Always Needed

Before running any command, collect if not provided:
- **Video topic or URL** (for video-specific commands)
- **Target audience** (WordPress devs, Elementor users, beginners, agencies)
- **Product being featured** (The Plus Addons, NexterWP, WDesignKit, UiChemy)
- **Goal** (views, subscribers, sales, traffic to docs)
