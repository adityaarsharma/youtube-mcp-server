## What This Is

A Claude Code skill suite + MCP server that connects your AI to your **real YouTube channel** — reads your private analytics, writes SEO back to YouTube, and publishes companion posts to WordPress. Not a generic creator template. Not another dashboard.

**Three things no other YouTube AI tool does:**

1. **Reads your private analytics** via OAuth — watch time, retention %, traffic sources, demographics. Not just public stats anyone can scrape.
2. **Writes back to YouTube** — pushes updated titles, descriptions, and tags directly from Claude. No opening YouTube Studio.
3. **Double-ranks on Google** — publishes a companion WordPress post with VideoObject schema so the same topic ranks on both Google and YouTube simultaneously.

```
/youtube-ideate  →  /youtube-script  →  /youtube-seo  →  push to YouTube
                                                        ↓
                                         /youtube-wp-post  →  published to WordPress
```

## Who This Is For

Built for **developers, consultants, and product makers** who use YouTube to build authority — not entertainment creators chasing trending content.

- You make tutorials, walkthroughs, or educational content in your niche
- You want **organic-only growth** — no paid ads, no bought subscribers, no gaming the system
- You have a product, service, open-source project, or community to grow through video
- You want **evergreen content** — videos that get discovered for years, not just 48 hours after upload

One subscriber from your niche is worth more than 10,000 random views. This tool understands that.

## Quick Start

**Three install modes — pick whichever fits.** Full guide: [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

| Mode | Node.js? | OAuth? | Live Channel Data | Best For |
|------|----------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **1. Skill-Only** | No | No | No | Trying it out, offline use |
| **2. Hosted MCP** | No | Yes (1-click web) | Yes | Most people — no install hassle |
| **3. Local MCP** | Yes | Yes (local) | Yes | Privacy maximalists, advanced users |

### Mode 1 — Skill-Only (60 seconds, no install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityaarsharma/youtube-marketing-skills.git
cp -r youtube-marketing-skills/skills/youtube-marketing ~/.claude/skills/
```

Open Claude Code, type `/youtube-strategy`. Done. Also works in Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI.

### Mode 2 — Hosted MCP (recommended — no Node.js, full live data)

1. Connect your YouTube at **[youtube-skills.adityaarsharma.com/connect](https://youtube-skills.adityaarsharma.com/connect)** (opens Google OAuth, returns a refresh token)
2. Add the hosted MCP URL + your token to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "youtube": {
      "url": "https://youtube-mcp.adityaarsharma.com/sse",
      "transport": "sse",
      "env": { "YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your-token-here" }
    }
  },
  "skills": ["~/.claude/skills/youtube-marketing/SKILL.md"]
}
```

**Privacy:** The hosted MCP is a stateless relay. **We don't store your data, analytics, or tokens.** Each request passes through with your token, hits YouTube's API, returns the response. Nothing is logged or persisted server-side. The code running is exactly what's in [`server.js`](server.js) — open source, auditable.

### Mode 3 — Local MCP (full control)

```bash
npx youtube-channel-mcp
node auth.js   # OAuth runs locally, tokens stay on your machine
```

Requires Node.js 18+ and a Google Cloud OAuth project. Nothing leaves your machine.

Add to Claude Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "youtube": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["youtube-channel-mcp"]
    }
  },
  "skills": ["/path/to/youtube-marketing-skills/skills/youtube-marketing/SKILL.md"]
}
```

Configure your channel once — open `skills/youtube-marketing/SKILL.md` and set:

```markdown
Channel: [Your channel name and handle]
Products: [Your products with URLs]
Best publish time: [Your optimal time + timezone]
Fixed links: [Product / docs / community URLs to embed in every description]
```

Every command now knows your business. Start with:

```
/youtube-ideate
```

## The Organic Growth Playbook

No ads. No paid promotion. No viral luck. This is how personal brands compound on YouTube.

### 1. Find Evergreen Gaps

Evergreen content = keywords with consistent monthly search volume, not trending spikes that collapse in a week.

`/youtube-ideate` pulls live keyword data and surfaces gaps: real searches with volume that your competitors aren't targeting yet.

**What to look for:** Keywords where the top-ranking videos are 12+ months old, have weak titles, or come from channels outside your niche. That's unclaimed territory.

### 2. One Video, Three Discovery Paths

Every video you make should be built to win across three separate discovery systems:

- **YouTube Search** — title + description + tags targeting one specific query
- **Google Search** — companion WordPress post with VideoObject schema (same topic, two rankings)
- **Suggested** — thumbnail + hook optimized for your existing subscriber cohort

`/youtube-seo` + `/youtube-wp-post` handles all three in one workflow.

### 3. The Compounding Loop

```
Month 1:  Publish optimized tutorial → earns YouTube Search traffic
Month 2:  Companion post ranks on Google → new audience discovers the video
Month 3:  Video earns Suggested placement from a similar viewer cohort
Month 6:  Run /youtube-batch-seo → refresh titles with updated keyword data
Year 1:   This video drives 30–40% of your channel's total subscriber growth
```

`/youtube-batch-seo` automates the quarterly refresh. It finds your underperforming videos and pushes improved SEO — without you touching YouTube Studio.

### 4. Build a Gap Map, Not Just a Content Calendar

Most creators plan content by topic. Personal brands should plan by competitive gap.

```
/youtube-competitor  →  find what your niche isn't covering yet
/youtube-ideate      →  rank those gaps by keyword volume and competition score
/youtube-calendar    →  sequence by production effort and seasonal timing
```

This is the difference between a content calendar and a growth strategy.

## FAQ

### Is this a free VidIQ alternative?

Yes. 100% free, open source, MIT licensed. No subscription, no paywalled features, no usage limits. Everything VidIQ charges $49–$99/month for — keyword research, SEO scoring, bulk SEO updates, channel audits — runs locally on your machine with this toolkit.

### Can Claude AI manage my YouTube channel?

Yes — with Path 2 (live mode), Claude connects to your channel via OAuth and can read your private analytics (watch time, retention, traffic sources) and write back SEO updates (title, description, tags) directly. You stay in control: Claude proposes changes, you approve before they push.

### Do I need to install Node.js?

No — there are two no-Node paths:

- **Mode 1 (Skill-Only)** — pure markdown skills, no server, no install. Trade-off: no live channel data, you paste analytics in manually.
- **Mode 2 (Hosted MCP)** — uses our free hosted MCP endpoint at `youtube-mcp.adityaarsharma.com`. You get full live channel data + SEO write-back without installing Node. The hosted endpoint is a stateless relay — we don't store your tokens or data.

Only **Mode 3 (Local MCP)** requires Node.js. That's for users who want everything running on their own machine with zero third parties.

### Does the hosted MCP store my YouTube data or auth tokens?

No. The hosted MCP at `youtube-mcp.adityaarsharma.com` is a **stateless relay**. Each request you send includes your OAuth token, the server uses it once to call YouTube's API, returns the response, and forgets it. No database, no logs of your tokens, no persistence of your channel data. The exact code running is in [`server.js`](server.js) — open source and auditable. If you don't trust the hosted version, run the same code yourself with Mode 3.

### How is this different from claude-youtube by AgriciDaniel?

claude-youtube is skill-only — you paste analytics in manually. This repo offers both: pure skill mode + a live MCP server that reads private analytics and writes SEO directly to YouTube. You also get a WordPress companion-post pipeline, batch SEO updates, and 21 commands vs 14.

### How is this different from VidIQ or TubeBuddy?

VidIQ and TubeBuddy show you scores. This gives you a workflow. They suggest keywords; this pushes the optimized title directly to YouTube. They give you a CTR number; this diagnoses why CTR is low and rewrites your thumbnail brief. They cost $49–$99/month; this is free and runs on your machine.

### How do I grow a YouTube channel without paid ads?

Use the **Organic Growth Playbook** above: find evergreen keyword gaps (`/youtube-ideate`), publish optimized tutorials with companion WordPress posts (`/youtube-wp-post`), then run `/youtube-batch-seo` quarterly to refresh older videos. This stacks YouTube Search + Google Search + Suggested traffic into one compounding system. No paid ads required.

### What is a YouTube MCP server?

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is a local program that gives AI agents like Claude direct access to a service. This repo's MCP server exposes 10 YouTube tools — read analytics, search your channel, update video SEO — so Claude can act on your real channel data. It runs entirely on your machine via OAuth2; nothing is sent to third parties.

### Does this work with channels that have a product to sell?

Yes — it was specifically built for channels where one subscriber is worth more than 10,000 ad views. Configure your products and fixed links once in `SKILL.md`, then every command writes descriptions, CTAs, and funnels around your real product pages. There are channel templates for plugin/SaaS, agency, consultancy, personal brand, and tutorial channels.

### Will this work for new channels under 1,000 subscribers?

Yes — the strategy and ideation commands work without any channel data (`/youtube-strategy`, `/youtube-ideate`, `/youtube-script`, `/youtube-hook`, `/youtube-thumbnail`). Live analytics commands obviously need an existing channel. The Organic Growth Playbook is designed to take a channel from zero to its first thousand subscribers using SEO-driven discovery.
